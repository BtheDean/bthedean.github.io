<div class="page">
  <h1 class="page-title">404: Page not found</h1>
  <p class="lead">Ooops! You have confused the Internet. </p>
  <p class="lead">Actually, either we've misplaced that URL or it's pointing to something that doesn't exist.</p>
  <p class="lead">May we suggest <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">heading back home</a> and then try to find it again.</p>
